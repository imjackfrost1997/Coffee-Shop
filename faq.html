                            <p>No. First, Espresso is not a particular coffee roast; it is a method of brewing coffee. The only particular attribute of the coffee before it goes in the espresso maker is that it must be finely ground. Many coffees claim to be Espresso roasts because the darker, longer roasted coffees are preferred. In fact, the best so-called Espresso coffees are blends of different flavorful coffees, a dark French or Italian roast being just one.</p>

                            <p>Yes. Caffeinated coffee has more caffeine than decaffeinated. As for naturally occurring caffeine content… the fact is, the coffee most used for favorable blends and specialty coffees, the honorable Arabica bean, has less than half the naturally occurring caffeine found in the less flavorful Robusta beans. Robustas are cheaper, lower quality bitter beans often used for blending in mass produced coffees, like the ones found in large plastic containers in your grocery store.</p>

                            <p>Body refers to the perceived weight of the coffee as it enters the palette. For instance, a Sumatran pedigree will feel like it has more body - or weight - than, say, a coffee from the Caribbean, which are perceived as lighter. Often coffees described as lighter also use the “acidic” description too. Where as, coffees with body will feel heavier, lighter coffees are said to be sharper, snappier, and more acidic - acidic like the sensation of sweet on the tongue. All coffee is acidic to a certain degree. Lighter roasts retain their natural acidity; darker roasts lose it in the roasting process.</p>

                            <p>If your backyard is a huge track of land on the Big Island of Hawaii or nestled on a hillside in lovely rural Guatemala, then you’ll have an above average chance. But growing a coffee tree and growing coffee are two different enterprises. The coffee tree’s flowers are pretty, but unless you’re prepared to make a sizeable investment in the other 70% of the process, don’t expect to be drinking a Cup o’ Joe fresh off the tree any time soon. As with most agricultural enterprises, Coffee cultivation is more involving than just growing a few trees. Add to the difficulties of growing, the art and science of proper harvesting, the expensive wet or dry processing of the beans, milling, and then the further art and science of roasting. Do you have some venture capitalists on the hook? If not, you might have better luck raising a dairy cow so at least you’ll have a stock of cream for your freshly arrived GoCoffeeGo.com order!</p>

                            <p>I’ll assume your asking about coffee that’s flavored before brewing… Flavored coffees, with such enticing labels as “Raspberry Chocolate Truffle” or “Cinnamon Vanilla Swirl,” are created just after the roasting process. Oily flavor derivatives in liquid form, either from natural ingredients or synthesized, are applied - soaked, dipped, sprayed - to coffee beans warm from the roaster. Coffee beans are not very porous, so flavors additives don’t penetrate very deep; it’s more ON the bean than IN the bean. The coated coffee is quickly packaged to minimize the flavor’s evaporation. The greatest impact on the coffee is the aroma when you open the bag. After getting a nose full of deliciously rich Chocolate Raspberry Truffle before brewing, your tongue may be somewhat disappointed when drinking. Many additives don’t translate well to the cup and are mild when diluted in water. If you’re looking for more than just a “hint” of extra flavor in your cup, you are better off adding flavored syrups or powders after brewing.</p>

                            <p>What is a Peaberry? Why, of course it’s ME! A fabulous Professor of coffee loved by women, men and, uh.... Oh, uh, you mean the bean? Well, a Peaberry is a special and more rare type of coffee bean. You see, the coffee bean is actually the seed of the coffee tree’s fruit, referred to as a cherry, perhaps because of its similarity to an actual cherry. In fact, both are classified as “Drupes.” Most coffee beans develop into two parts, like a pea cut in half growing inside the same coffee cherry. Their pairing causes them to develop a flat side facing each other; hence they are referred to as “flat berries.” A Peaberry is rare single bean growing within the coffee cherry that take on a round, pea-like form, hence the name. Only 5% of coffee harvested are Peaberry beans and are smaller in size and twice as robust in flavor. Sound like someone you know?</p>
                            <p>Many believe that Peaberries roast better, more evenly, because of their round shape. They “roll” better in the roaster. Another reason for the perceived increase in quality may be that Peaberries have a much narrower, more careful selection process. Hence, a roasted Peaberry is the rarest among the rare. It’s a very fine distinction, but when it comes to the cup is there a discernible difference? You be the judge. Just remember: Peaberries are unique, exceptional and rare... like me!</p>

                            <p>If Arabica beans were a Prince, then Robusta beans would be the Prince’s more irritating, jealously competitive brother who was in line for the throne, but father passed him over for his more flavorful, higher quality son.</p>
                            <p>Robusta, or C. canephora, is a hardier, dare I say, “wilder” coffee bean originally grown in Africa and existing in the same Coffea genus as Arabica beans. In the real world of coffee production, hardier translates to easier to grow at low altitudes, which in turn translates to a lower cost, higher yield cultivation. See “cheaper”. The drawback is that Robustas aren’t nearly as flavorful as Arabicas, producing a bitter, more pungent taste.</p>
                            <p>What are the uses of such an inferior bean? Well, there is a market for harsher tasting coffee. The caffeine content of a Robusta roast is double that of the average Arabica, which might attract those looking to climb the face of Half Dome in half the time. Pure Robusta roasts are beloved by many in the Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam. In fact, Brazil and Indonesia, home of some of the highest quality Arabicas on the planet, grow far more Robustas than Arabicas.</p>
                            <p>The widest use of Robusta is as a filler for mass-produced, Arabica-based coffee blends and – oh dear! - instant coffee. That’s right: many store-bought, canned brands have a high percentage of Robusta blended in to keep the price down. One possible sign of Robusta use in a blend is the mention of Chicory. The spicy flavor of Chicory is excellent at masking pungent Robusta notes. Be warned: if you dare buy such mass-produced coffee, it has likely been “cut” with additives and lesser coffee, namely Robusta.</p>

                            <p>Aside from the value in purchasing a superior quality product, the answer is more about ethics than economics. The price of a pound of coffee at the wholesale level has plunged over the last decade, beginning in the late 1990’s. Countries like Vietnam and Brazil dominate the industry by producing lower quality, less flavorful Robusta beans (see above question: What is the difference between Arabica and Robusta beans?). Robustas are roasted to create the world’s leading canned and instant coffee brands, like Nestle and Folgers, which mix in small amounts of superior tasting Arabica to mask Robustas inferior flavor. The price is cheap, and it is flooding the marketplace supported by coffee buyers who choose price over quality. All of this is sending the price of high quality Arabica grown on generations-old coffee plantations in places like Nicaragua and Colombia to the floor. Poverty and homelessness have spread, as plantations can no longer pay the workers a fair wage. The Fair Trade coffee movement has greatly helped by locking in a price on coffee that helps support smaller independent growers so that workers can earn a livable wage. Buying specialty coffees like those certified in the Fair Trade programs, and supporting roasters who go above and beyond, paying substantially more than fair trade prices via Direct Trade and Relationship coffees are what we hope to educate our customers about. Supporting these roasters is a big step in supporting the fair treatment of farmers and their workers. We are proud to carry Relationship and Direct Trade coffees on GoCoffeeGo.com. It is a powerful message of quality over quantity, independent over corporate monopoly, and supports a fair price to help end poverty and economic oppression.</p>

                        <div class="faq__content">
                            <p>Once ripe coffee cherries are plucked from the tree, carefully by hand or machine, they are quickly moved into processing, usually within a day. There are two methods of processing coffee: the wet and the dry method.</p>
                            <p>With the Wet Processing Method, the coffee cherry’s pulp is first separated from the coffee seed using a pulping machine. The seeds then move on to the next step whereby the sticky mucilage coatings of the seed are removed. This is accomplished in one of three ways. In the first, the seeds are placed in water, from sophisticated large tanks to small, simple buckets, and allowed to soak or ferment the mucilage away. There is also a dry, water-free fermentation where the seeds sit in similar tanks or buckets and let nature take its course without the aid of water. A newer mechanical method uses a special machine to buff the mucilage from the seed. This latest method greatly reduces the amount of icky wasted water. Whichever method is used, the goal is a mucilage free seed known as “parchment.” The seeds are then rinsed and dried. Again, there are several methods. They can be laid out to dry for up to two weeks, while being turned or raked several times a day to enhance the process. This drying is accomplished on simple concrete “patios” or sophisticated drying racks that can be covered should wet weather arrive. Or the beans can be dried in forced air machines, salon style, if you will. Once the seed is dry, it is considered a stable “bean.”</p>
                            <p>With the Dry Processing Method, the pulping and fermenting stages are skipped and the coffee cherries are allowed to dry on the tree beyond their ripening. These coffee “raisins” are then harvested and either stored or transported for pulping and milling, where the good seeds are separated from un-ripened or unwanted beans, leaves and stems. Dry processing on the tree is risky in that the coffee fruit can over-ripen and fall to the ground to rot.</p>
